This the a repo for my final project

## Point of Sale System

This is a generic point of sale system design.  Ideally it this system can be easislly modified for various buisiness types by modifying the setup data.

### Elements that are required for this system include

* A minimum of 12 use cases - fully elaborated!
* A rough sketch of the UI of the system to give yourself some grounding .
* Architecture Diagram showing major systems.
* Class Diagram for major classes in your system - 12-15 classes.
* Create a sequence diagram for 1-3 objects that realize one of your use cases.
* Python application using the 6+ major classes demonstrating the core functionality - GUIs are NOT required.

## Functionality Demo

This is a walk through of the console screens simulating the login of a cashier and creating an order

### Bootstrap

The system is bootstrapped with the following command `python pos.py`. This initializes the main screen as seen below

```
Using SQLAlchemy version 1.3.13
